# Java Minesweeper

### Ben Schwartz

This is a fully functional version of Minesweeper implemented in Java, with customizable board sizes and accurate graphics. The project includes the following files:

- `Minesweeper.java`: the main class for the game, which includes methods for setting up the game board, handling user input, and updating the game state
- `Game.jcu` and `Game.jcw`: files used for storing the game board data and settings
- `TimerClass.java`: a helper class for managing the game timer
- `Frown.png`, `Glasses1.png`, `McKeenHead.PNG`, `Smile.png`, `blankTile.png`, `bombTile.png`, `flagTile.png`: image files used for rendering the game board
- `PLAY GAME.bat`: a script for launching the game on Windows systems

Please note that since this is a fully developed project, it has been a while since it has been run, and there may be compatibility issues with newer versions of Java or other software. 

To run the game, you can compile the `Minesweeper.java` file using your preferred Java compiler, and then launch the compiled program. The game supports customizable board sizes, and includes accurate graphics and sound effects.
